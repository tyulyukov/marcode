# Upstream Divergence Log

Tracks how MarCode's `main` relates to upstream `pingdotgg/t3code:main`. Its job is to prevent every sync cycle from re-deriving the same answers to:

1. Which upstream commits have we already ported? (under possibly-different SHAs)
2. Which upstream commits are we intentionally **not** porting? (and why)
3. Which upstream commits are genuinely still pending?

Complements [`FEATURES.md`](./FEATURES.md) — that one protects MarCode-exclusive features during merges. This one protects the merge _ledger_ itself.

> Sister file: [`FEATURES.md`](./FEATURES.md) lists the features we **add** and must not lose.

## How to use this doc

When starting a new upstream sync:

```bash
git fetch upstream
# Strict "no patch-equivalent" set — includes ported-under-different-SHA
git cherry origin/main upstream/main | grep "^+ " | awk '{print $2}' > /tmp/raw_missing.txt

# Subtract the "already-equivalent" set below — those have different SHAs by design
# Subtract the "intentionally-skipped" set below — those we're never porting
# What remains is real work
```

Sections are ordered by action:

1. [Ported in the current cycle](#ported-in-the-current-cycle) — new SHAs on `main`
2. [Already equivalent under a different SHA](#already-equivalent-under-a-different-sha) — do **not** re-port
3. [Intentionally skipped](#intentionally-skipped) — do **not** port
4. [Pending real work](#pending-real-work) — what's actually left

**Conflict resolutions applied:**

- `ChatView.tsx` — kept `@marcode/shared/git` + upstream `useMediaQuery` / `RIGHT_PANEL_INLINE_LAYOUT_MEDIA_QUERY` imports side-by-side.
- `main.ts` (desktop) — applied upstream's dev/prod `APP_USER_MODEL_ID` split to MarCode's namespace: `com.marcode.marcode.dev` / `com.marcode.marcode`.
- `release-smoke.ts` — kept upstream's `assertExists` / `assertMissing` helpers, kept `marcode-release-smoke-` tempdir prefix.
- `ProviderService.ts` (#2292) — dropped the upstream `analytics.record("provider.session.started", …)` call; MarCode has no analytics (see [FEATURES.md §"Telemetry Removal"](./FEATURES.md#telemetry-removal)).
- `ProviderService.test.ts` — swapped `AnalyticsService.layerTest` → `AnalyticsServiceNoopLive` (MarCode exposes only a noop).
- `ProviderCommandReactor.test.ts` ("restarts the provider session when the thread workspace changes") — replaced the hardcoded `/tmp/provider-project-worktree` with a real `mkdtempSync` dir, because MarCode's `ProviderCommandReactor.ts:302` auto-archives threads with missing worktree paths (MarCode behavior: [#54e6ddc2](https://github.com/tyulyukov/marcode/commit/54e6ddc2) "Handle missing worktree directories gracefully"). Without a real dir the session restart short-circuits to auto-archive and the test times out.

### PR #67 — toast close buttons

| Upstream                                               | Subject                     | New SHA     |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| [#2023](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/pull/2023) | Add close buttons to toasts | `bb5d51097` |

**Conflict resolutions applied:**

- `toast.tsx` — took upstream's version wholesale (492 → 719 lines). Upstream already bundled `CopyErrorButton` at line 93, so no manual re-integration needed.
- `Sidebar.tsx` — preserved MarCode's "Delete anyway" warning toast flow (action button → deferred close → `api.dialogs.confirm` with thread-count messaging → `removeProject({ force: true })` → inline error toast). Wrapped all toast calls via the new `stackedThreadToast(...)` helper for layout consistency.

### PR #69 — sidebar row timestamp (part 1 of upstream #1996)

| Upstream                                               | Subject                                                  | New SHA     |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| [#1996](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/pull/1996) | Use latest user message time for thread timestamps (row) | `524e93afd` |

Narrow behavioral port: `Sidebar.tsx:715` thread-row label now falls back `thread.latestUserMessageAt ?? thread.updatedAt ?? thread.createdAt`. Matches the helper already in `CommandPalette.logic.ts:161`.

### PR #70 — shell-stream authority for sidebar summary (part 2 of upstream #1996)

| Upstream                                               | Subject                                                             | New SHA     |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| [#1996](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/pull/1996) | Use latest user message time for thread timestamps (store refactor) | `506b808c2` |

**Correctness fix, not cleanup.** Removes the client-derived `buildSidebarThreadSummary` path in `store.ts` that was overwriting server-authoritative sidebar flags (`hasPendingApprovals`, `hasPendingUserInput`, `hasActionableProposedPlan`, `latestUserMessageAt`) during every detail-stream write. Matches the stream-separation contract MEMORY.md requires (guards against "ghost Pending Approval badges on resolved threads"). Tests in `store.test.ts` describe block "shell events are authoritative for sidebar summary flags" rewritten to assert the new contract: detail stream must not touch sidebar; shell stream is the sole writer.

What we deliberately did NOT port from upstream #1996: structural reorganization of `store.ts` (commentary, `ensureThreadRegistered` extraction, `retainThreadScopedRecord` changes). MarCode's Incremental Event Handling & Structural Sharing (FEATURES.md §1) already covers the functional behavior; upstream's cosmetic reshuffle is net risk for no gain.

**Verification strategy for re-checking in a later cycle:** grep for the symbol the upstream PR adds. If it's already in MarCode, confirm; do not cherry-pick.

## Intentionally skipped

These upstream commits are **never** to be ported unless MarCode's release pipeline adopts the underlying infrastructure. Moving them in creates conflicts without value.

### Blacksmith runners (skipped)

MarCode uses GitHub-hosted runners. Blacksmith adoption would require account setup, billing, and pipeline changes that aren't on the roadmap.

- [#2101](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/pull/2101) `try out blacksmith for releases`
- [#2103](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/pull/2103) `Revert to Github Runner for Windows` — no-op since blacksmith never adopted
- [#2129](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/pull/2129) `Modernize release workflow runners` — the actual migration commit
- [#2146](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/pull/2146) `Guard release workflow jobs from upstream failures` — context depends on blacksmith runners
- [#2147](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/pull/2147) `Guard release workflow jobs on upstream success` — same

### Nightly release channel (skipped)

MarCode ships semver alphas (`1.0.0-alpha.*`), not nightly builds. Adopting nightlies would fragment the update channel.

- [#2012](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/pull/2012) `Nightly release channel`
- [#2025](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/pull/2025) `Fix nightly desktop product name`
- [#2049](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/pull/2049) `Default nightly desktop builds to the nightly update channel`
- [#2134](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/pull/2134) `Throttle nightly release workflow to every 3 hours`
- [#2186](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/pull/2186) `fix(release): use v<semver> tag format for nightly releases`

### Fork-specific release operations (skipped)

- [#2149](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/pull/2149) `Use GitHub App token for release uploads` — requires `RELEASE_APP_ID` / `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` secrets configured for the t3tools org, not the fork.
- `2d87574e` `chore(release): prepare v0.0.20` — bumps to upstream's 0.0.x version scheme, collides with MarCode's `1.0.0-alpha.*`.
- `ada410bc` `chore(release): prepare v0.0.21` — same.

Touches every `*TextGeneration.ts` (collides with FEATURES.md §"Claude-Powered Text Generation") and the MarCode provider instance registry work (`0e71e3023`, `42b428826`, `4da47be23`). 67 files, +3403/-3828.

## Merging workflow (lessons from this cycle)

1. **Cherry-pick, don't merge.** A single `git merge upstream/main` produces a wall of conflicts on FEATURES.md-protected files, because MarCode has re-implemented many upstream commits under different SHAs. Cherry-pick individual PRs or small logical groupings into `marcode/port-*` branches.
2. **Use `git cherry-pick -x`.** The `(cherry picked from commit <sha>)` trailer is the fork's audit trail.
3. **Always run `bun run typecheck` + `apps/*/vitest run` locally before pushing.** CI surprises from telemetry-removal leftovers and MarCode-specific behaviors (worktree auto-archive, structural sharing) are common.
4. **Skip-list over port-list.** This doc's `Already equivalent` and `Intentionally skipped` sections save more time on the _next_ cycle than any single port. Keep it honest.
5. **Preserve FEATURES.md exclusives by hand.** Upstream refactors (see PR #67 `Sidebar.tsx` resolution) often simplify flows we deliberately made richer. Re-wire the richer flow through any upstream helper rather than reverting to the simpler variant.
